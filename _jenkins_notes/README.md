## Jenkins Pipeline?

- Jenkins Pipeline (or simply "Pipeline") is a suite of plugins which supports implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines into Jenkins.
- A continuous delivery pipeline is an automated expression of your process for getting software from version control right through to your users and customers.
- Jenkins Pipeline provides an extensible set of tools for modeling simple-to-complex delivery pipelines "as code". The definition of a Jenkins Pipeline is typically written into a text file (called a Jenkinsfile) which in turn is checked into a projectâ€™s source control repository.

## Jenkinsfile

- Text file that contains defintion of Jenkins Pipeline.
- Include in source (Jenkinsfile at root of repo).

```
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building..'
            }
        }
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing..'
            }
        }
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying....'
            }
        }
    }
}
```
